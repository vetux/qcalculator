# Known Issues
- Writing archive files ("Create Addon Bundle" or "Compress...") on Windows causes the resulting file to be a corrupted archive.

## Developing Addons
Addons are python files containing load and unload methods that are called when the user enables the
addon in the user interface.

To be able to install the addon through the user interface the addon must be packaged into an addon bundle.

Addon bundles can be created by selecting the "Create Addon Bundle" option in the "Tools" menu or by creating an archive file compatible with libarchive containing the addon_bundle.json and modules / package files.

Examples of using PySide2 to modify the interface and using exprtk to modify the symbol table aswell as the default addons can be found in [python/addon](python/addon/).

The [python/lib]("python/lib") directory contains the qcalculator packages for interfacing with the native window and symbol table.
